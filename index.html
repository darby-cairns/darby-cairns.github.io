	<h2><span>Background</span></h2>
	<p>I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech working with Elizabeth Cherry in the CSE department.</p>
	<p>While earning my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to work with Elizabeth Cherry on her research in cardiac electrophysiology. Broadly speaking, this is the study of how electrical waveforms propagate across cardiac tissue. In a healthy heart, the heartbeat is controlled by a cluster of cells known as the sinoatrial node. This node periodically stimulates the surrounding cardiac tissue, inducing contraction, and beginning a heartbeat. As these cells are excited, they in turn excite the cells surrounding them, and this electrical wave propagates across the heart. By studying mathematical models of these phenomena, we gain greater insight into their underlying mechanics, and hopefully make progress towards better detection, treatment, an prevention of cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. After graduating, I continued working with professor Cherry as a research assitant, eventually culminating in a publication (see below). My interests include cardiac modeling and machine learning. Moving forward I hope to expand my knowledge in these areas, and hopefully develop a novel and useful application of machine learning to the domain of cardiac electrophysiology.
